## Quick start

```
$ bundler install trackstamps-reborn
```

### Hook current_user into CurrentAttributes

```ruby
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  before_action :set_trackstamps_user  

  def set_trackstamps_user
    Trackstamps::Reborn::Current.user = current_user
    # or use your current attributes class with proc override in initializers
    YourCurrentAttributesClass.user = current_user
  end
end
```

### Override implementation for current user

```ruby
## filename: config/initializers/trackstamps-reborn.rb
Trackstamps::Reborn.config.get_current_user = -> { YourCurrentAttributesClass.user }
# or
Trackstamps::Reborn[:alternative].config.get_current_user = -> { YourAlternativeCurrentAttributesClass.user }
```

### Generate migrations
```
rails generate trackstamps:reborn:migration table_name
```

## Include trackstamps
```ruby
class Example < ActiveRecord::Base
  include Trackstamps::Reborn
  # or
  include Trackstamps::Reborn[:whatever]
end
```

## Multiple configuration

Multiple configuration is achieved with module builder pattern utilizing `self.[]` method.
Upon calling

```ruby
Trackstamps::Reborn[:whatever]
```
